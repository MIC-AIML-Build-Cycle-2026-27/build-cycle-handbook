## Overview

TBD. A short paragraph explaining the project in plain language. Someone outside the team should understand what you are building after reading it.

## Problem Statement

TBD. What problem exists today, who has it, and why existing approaches are not good enough.

## Objective

TBD. What the project aims to achieve by the end of the Build Cycle. Keep it concrete and checkable.

## Proposed Solution

TBD. The approach the team is taking, at a high level. Note the main alternatives you considered and why you chose this one.

## Architecture

TBD. Add a diagram once the design settles (an image in `docs/` or a Mermaid diagram works well). Describe the main components and how data moves between them.

More detail: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)

Update this tree as the project grows. Add folders such as `experiments/`, `evaluation/`, `notebooks/`, `data/`, `frontend/` or `backend/` when the project needs them. See the [handbook](https://github.com/MIC-AIML-Build-Cycle-2026-27/build-cycle-handbook/blob/main/docs/development-workflow.md#adapting-the-repository-structure) for guidance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- TBD (language runtime, package manager, GPU/API access, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIC-AIML-Build-Cycle-2026-27/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>
# TBD: install dependencies
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your own values if the project needs API keys or other configuration. Never commit `.env`.

## Usage

TBD. How to run the project and a minimal example of it working.

## Development Workflow

1. Pick or create an issue on the project board.
2. Create a branch from `main`: `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `research/<name>`, `experiment/<name>` or `docs/<name>`.
3. Commit small, focused changes.
4. Open a pull request linked to the issue.
5. Get at least one review and passing CI, then merge.

Full details are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Testing

TBD. How to run the tests, for example:

```bash
# TBD: test command
```

## Evaluation

TBD. How the team measures whether the system works: datasets, metrics, baselines and how to reproduce the results. Define metrics before claiming results.
